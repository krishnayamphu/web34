      A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out
      sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern
      digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known
      as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
      tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer
      that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral
      equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers
      that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
      computer cluster.

      Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly
      using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device
      was most likely a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids
      throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones,
      etc.) which represented counts of items, likely livestock or grains,
      sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4] The use of counting rods
      is one example. The Chinese suanpan (算盘). The number represented on this
      abacus is 6,302,715,408. The abacus was initially used for arithmetic
      tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as
      early as 2400 BCE. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or
      tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a
      checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it
      according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5]

      The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are
      tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound
      cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables,
      keyboards, printers and "mice" input devices are all hardware. Lorem ipsum
